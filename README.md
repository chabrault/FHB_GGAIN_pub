-   Date of data collection (single date, range, approximate date): 1995-2024

-   Geographic location of data collection: Northern Great Plains-Midwest of the U.S (MN, ND, SD, MT, Manitoba)

-   Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data: U.S Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative, USDA-ARS.

-   Overview of the data (abstract): 
Fusarium head blight (FHB or scab) is a devastating disease affecting wheat worldwide. 
In the Northern Great Plains US region, public breeding programs had been addressing FHB, but it became a bigger issue in the 1990s, prompting greater focus on resistance efforts. 
Harnessing public data from two spring wheat nurseries, this study compares the rate of genetic gain for FHB resistance, examines the frequency of the major FHB quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and evaluates their effect on FHB and a set of agronomic traits. 
The URN (uniform regional nursery) is used to test variety release candidates with good agronomic qualities, while the URSN (uniform regional scab nursery) is used to facilitate the phenotyping of FHB resistance and to exchange germplasm among the cooperating breeding programs. 
We show that FHB resistance has increased significantly over the years for FHB-related traits, with a higher rate for the initially more susceptible URN materials. 
For example, the average disease index has halved over the last 30 years. The frequency of the resistance QTLs Fhb1, Fhb5, and Fhb5AS has increased over the years, with a higher frequency in URSN materials. 
Each of the resistance QTL alleles was significantly associated with increased FHB resistance, with up to a 46% decrease for the disease index trait associated with Fhb5. 
There was no detrimental association between the presence of resistance alleles and important agronomic traits. 
This work illustrates progress achieved through breeding to provide growers with wheat genotypes possessing improved FHB resistance levels.

# Data and file description

## Data


- `data/URSN_trial_info.csv` GPS coordinates of the URSN trial locations.

- `data/dat_FHB_URSN_URNFHB.tsv` Curated phenotypic data for the URSN population and for the URN population for FHB traits.

- `data/all_inputs_URN_URSN_URNFHB.rds` List of formatted inputs.

- `data/genotype_information_URN_URSN_URNFHB.tsv` Table of genomic information for URN and URSN populations, notably their source and first year of testing.


## Code

-   `useful_functions.R` Script which wraps custom useful functions for pre-processing, analyzing data and producing results.

## Analysis scripts

### Inputs

- `analysis/explore_inputs.Rmd` In this script, we load the phenotypic data, explore the experimental design, the phenotypic correlations and the genetic composition of the URN and the URSN populations.

- `analysis/extract_genoVal_URN_URSN_FHB.Rmd` In this script, we load the phenotypic data for the FHB traits and extract the BLUEs (Best Linear Unbiased Estimators) for the genotypes in the URN and URSN populations. The BLUEs are used as inputs for the genetic gain analysis and the QTL analysis.

- `analysis/extract_genoVal_URN.Rmd` In this script, we load the phenotypic data for the agronomic traits and extract the BLUEs for the genotypes in the URN population. The BLUEs are used as inputs for the genetic gain analysis.

#### Genetic gain

- `analysis/URN_URSN_FHB_GGAIN_BLUEs.Rmd`. In this script, we load the BLUEs for the FHB traits and the URSN trial information, we compute the genetic gain for three FHB traits (DIS, VSK and DON) in the URSN population and compare it with the genetic gain in the URN population.

### FHB QTLs

- `analysis/URN_URSN_QTL_frequency.Rmd`. In this script, we load phenotypic data and environmental covariates (ECs), we apply Finlay-Wilkinson regression to predict reaction norm intercept, slope, and phenotypic values based on mean phenotype and ECs. We compare the results with genomic prediction.

- `analysis/explore_FHB_QTL_effect_URN-URSN.Rmd`. In this script, we load the BLUEs from the phenoypic data for all the traits and the FHB QTLs for the URN and URSN populations, we explore the effect of the FHB QTLs on the FHB traits (DIS, VSK and DON) and on three agronomic traits (HT, PH and YLD).
